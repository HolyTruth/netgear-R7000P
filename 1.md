## **3. Vulnerability details

The function "sub_9E800" contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability by using "read_access". In the function, it reads in a user-provided parameter, and the variable is passed to the function without any length check, which may lead to overflow of the stack-based buffer. As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution with carefully crafted overflow data.
